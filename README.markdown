# The Motoko Package Manager
Motoko is a set of traditionalist SVR4-compatible package managenment tools, but made in a modernist and cleaner way.  
I'm making this in order to learn Go and some data structure concepts.  

Everything here is a big "TO DO", since I'm still learning the basic concepts of
Go itself and the SVR4 package manager specification.
